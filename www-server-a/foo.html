<h1>Server A - FOO</h1>

<p>To be, or not to be, that is the question:</p>
<p>Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer</p>
<p>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,</p>
<p>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles</p>
<p>And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep,</p>
<p>No more; and by a sleep to say we end</p>
<p>The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks</p>
<p>That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation</p>
<p>Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;</p>
<p>To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub:</p>
<p>For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,</p>
<p>When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,</p>
<p>Must give us pause—there's the respect</p>
<p>That makes calamity of so long life.</p>
<p>For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,</p>
<p>Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,</p>
<p>The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay,</p>
<p>The insolence of office, and the spurns</p>
<p>That patient merit of th'unworthy takes,</p>
<p>When he himself might his quietus make</p>
<p>With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,</p>
<p>To grunt and sweat under a weary life,</p>
<p>But that the dread of something after death,</p>
<p>The undiscovere'd country, from whose bourn</p>
<p>No traveller returns, puzzles the will,</p>
<p>And makes us rather bear those ills we have</p>
<p>Than fly to others that we know not of?</p>
<p>Thus conscience doth make cowards of us all,</p>
<p>And thus the native hue of resolution</p>
<p>Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,</p>
<p>And enterprises of great pith and moment</p>
<p>With this regard their currents turn awry</p>
<p>And lose the name of action.</p>
